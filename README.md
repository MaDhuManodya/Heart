# Logistic Regression vs. Random Forest Classification with Fuzzy Logic

## Project Overview

In this project, we compare the performance of two popular classification algorithms—**Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**—on a real-world dataset. Additionally, we explore **Fuzzy Logic** as a tool for decision-making and model enhancement. The goal is to evaluate and analyze their effectiveness in predicting the target variable, assess model performance, and validate the results using statistical methods like permutation testing.

## Data Description
- The dataset used in this project consists of [briefly describe the data, e.g., features and target variable].
- The dataset is split into training and test sets, with the training data used to train the models and the test data used to evaluate their performance.

## Model Implementation

### Logistic Regression
- **Logistic Regression** is a linear model used for binary classification tasks. In this project, it is implemented using **Scikit-learn's** `LogisticRegression` class.
- We performed data preprocessing and trained the model using the training set.

### Random Forest
- **Random Forest** is an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing a multitude of decision trees. It is implemented using **Scikit-learn's** `RandomForestClassifier`.
- We trained the Random Forest model using the same training data as the Logistic Regression model.

## Fuzzy Logic Integration
- **Fuzzy Logic** is implemented using the **scikit-fuzzy** library to incorporate fuzzy decision-making into the model. Fuzzy logic allows for reasoning about uncertain or imprecise information, which can be useful in scenarios where traditional machine learning models struggle with ambiguity.
- In this project, fuzzy rules were applied to adjust model predictions or enhance decision thresholds, potentially improving model robustness.

```python
import skfuzzy as fuzz
import numpy as np

# Example fuzzy rule for adjusting model prediction:
x = np.arange(0, 11, 1)
y = fuzz.trimf(x, [0, 5, 10])

# This rule would be used to adjust confidence in model output
